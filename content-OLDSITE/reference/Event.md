> The InteractionEvent hierarchy.

Although not supported by the default programming model, the applib
nevertheless defines an event hierarchy that characterizes all of the
different types of interactions that can occur. This is used by the
[wrapper factory](./services/wrapper-factory.html) service, and is exploited 
by the core [integration testing](../core/integtestsupport.html) support.

The following UML class diagram shows the hierarchy of events:
