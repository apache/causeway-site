Encodability means the ability to convert an object to-and-from a
string, by way of the `org.apache.isis.applib.adapters.EncoderDecoder`
interface. Generally this only applies to value types, where the `@Value`
annotation implies encodability through the `ValueSemanticsProvider` interface.

For these reasons the `@Encodable` annotation is generally never applied
directly, but can be thought of as a placeholder for future enhancements
whereby non-value types might also be directly encoded.
