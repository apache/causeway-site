A 'profile store' is a mechanism to store information about a current user of the system. This information is predominantly for use by viewer implementations, eg to store user preferences, bookmarks or view configurations.

The xml profile store provides a simple way to persist user profiles to file storage. The format of this file is a proprietary XML schema.
