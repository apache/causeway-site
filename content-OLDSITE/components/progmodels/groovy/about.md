Title: Groovy Programming Model

{note
This component is not under active development, but may be resurrected in the future.
}

A 'programming model' means the support for various programming conventions and annotations used by Isis to build up its internal metamodel.

The groovy progmodel implementation, which extends the default programming model provided with [core](../../../core/about.html) is intended to allow domain objects to be written in [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org).
