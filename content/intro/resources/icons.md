Title: Icons

Most Isis viewers use icons to help identify domain objects in the user interface.  It's a good idea to ensure that these are styled consistently.  To get you started, we couple of basic icon sets:

* [haywood](https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/src/site/resources/images/icons/haywood.zip?raw=true)
* [nogl](https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/src/site/resources/images/icons/nogl.zip?raw=true)


## Third Party Icon Sets

There are also various open source icon sets for both personal and commercial use (though some require a link back to the authors website):

* [icons8](http://icons8.com/) (as used in the [Estatio](../powered-by/powered-by.html) app) - styled for Win8, Android and MacOS

* [tango desktop](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library) icon set - as used in Linux GNOME and KDE desktops

* [the noun project](http://thenounproject.com/) community of icon providers (both free and commercial)

* [flaticon](http://www.flaticon.com/) - free vector icons

* [batch](http://adamwhitcroft.com/batch/) (300+ icons)


If you know of any others freely usable and easily accessible, let us know through the [mailing list](../../support.html).
