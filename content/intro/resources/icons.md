Title: Icons

Most Isis viewers use icons to help identify domain objects in the user interface.  It's a good idea to ensure that these are styled consistently.  To get you started, we couple of basic icon sets:

* [haywood](https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/src/site/resources/images/icons/haywood.zip?raw=true)
* [nogl](https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/src/site/resources/images/icons/nogl.zip?raw=true)


## Third Party Icon Sets

There are also various open source icon sets for both personal and commercial use (though some require a link back to the authors website).

* A good icon set to get started with is the [tango desktop](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library) set.

* Another icon set (as used in the [Estatio](../powered-by/powered-by.html) app) is [icons8](http://icons8.com/) website.  This has 1500+ icons in the style of Windows 8 and iOS7.
