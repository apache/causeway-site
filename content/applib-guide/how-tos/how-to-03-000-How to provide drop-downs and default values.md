Invoking actions or setting properties requires that the user specify a
valid value; of the correct type, and that passes any validation rules
that may have been defined. To make things are easier for the user, you
can provide lists of choices; viewers typically render these values in a
drop-down list box.

In a similar vein, there may be a default value for an action parameter;
this can also be specified.
