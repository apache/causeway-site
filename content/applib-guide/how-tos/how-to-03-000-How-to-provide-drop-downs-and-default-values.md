Invoking actions or setting properties requires that the user specify a
valid value; of the correct type, and that passes any validation rules
that may have been defined. To make things are easier for the user, you
can provide either a lists of choices, or an autocomplete box (where the user enters a single string which is used to locate candidates).  In both cases viewers render the candidate values in a drop-down list box.

Of the candidate values, there may be a default value for an action parameter (for example the current value of some corresponding property on the object).  This can also be specified.
