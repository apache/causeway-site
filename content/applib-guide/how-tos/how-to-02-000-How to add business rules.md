Business rules can be added to domain objects in a number of ways. As
well as the business logic encapsulated by domain object actions, the
framework also supports a number of conventions that allow a domain
entity or service's members to be made visible or hidden, to be enabled
or disabled (greyed out), and to validate arguments when invoking an
action, setting a new value for a property, or if adding a new element
to a collection.

Or, in other words: "see it, use it, do it".
