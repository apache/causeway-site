Isis graduated from the Apache incubator in October 2012; we are currently setting ourselves up as a top-level project.

In the meantime you can access our original incubator website [here](http://incubator.apache.org/isis "Apache Isis (incubator website)").

Code formatting (as documented in the `0.2.0-incubating` version of the contributors guide):

- code formatting should be checked as per sec.CodeStyleFormatter
- imports should be organized as per sec.ImportOrder
- cleanup should be performed as per sec.CodeStyleCleanup
  (this performs both code formatting and organizing imports)

In addition:

- checkstyle, as per sec.Checkstyle
- PMD, as per sec.PMD
- findbugs, as per sec.FindBugs
