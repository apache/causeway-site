Title: Wrapper Programming Model

A 'programming model' means the support for various programming conventions and annotations used by Isis to build up its internal metamodel.

The wrapper progmodel implementation, which builds on the default programming model provided in [core](../../../core/about.html) provides the ability for domain objects to be wrapped such that interactions between domain objects can be "as if" through the viewer. (In other words, business rule constraints are applied).
