Title: Restful Objects viewer

The restfulobjects viewer provides a RESTful interface to the domain object model, running over the HTTP protocol, and implemented as a webapp (servlet).

Each domain object (or part of object) is exposed as a RESTful resource, in a JSON representation.

The viewer is an implementation of the [Restful Objects](http://restfulobjects.org) specification, intended to allow other server-side frameworks to be implemented to support the same protocol.  It currently implements **v0.56** of the spec.
