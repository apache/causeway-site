Title: Pretty Printing (1.8.0-SNAPSHOT)

The JSON representations generated by the Restful Objects viewer are in compact form if the 
[deployment type](../../../reference/deployment-types.html) is SERVER (ie production), but will automatically be 
"pretty printed" (in other words indented) if the deployment type is PROTOTYPE.
