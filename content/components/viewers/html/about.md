Title: HTML Viewer

{note
This component is no longer under active development.  We recommend you use either the [Wicket](../wicket/about.html) viewer or the [Scimpi](../scimpi/about.html) viewer instead.
}

The HTML viewer provides a simple webapp interface for interacting with an Isis domain model.

It renders each domain object or collection of domain objects as a web page, with hyperlinks used to navigate between objects. In addition, object actions can also be invoked, with hyperlinks bringing up a page for action parameters if required.

The HTML viewer offers only very limited customization opportunities; the CSS can be altered, but that's about it.
