Title: File upload/download

The Isis application library provides the [Blob](../../../reference/value-types.html) type (binary large objects) and 
[Clob](../../../reference/value-types.html) type (character large object), each of which also includes metadata about the data (specifically the filename and mime type).

A class can define a property using either of these types, for example:

    private Blob attachment;

    @javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent(defaultFetchGroup="false")
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true")
    public Blob getAttachment() {
        return attachment;
    }

    public void setAttachment(final Blob attachment) {
        this.attachment = attachment;
    }

The `Blob` and `Clob` types can also be used as parameters to actions.
