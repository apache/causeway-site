Title: Gmap3 (google maps) extension for Wicket viewer

This [Wicket extension](https://github.com/danhaywood/isis-wicket-gmap3) renders a collection of entities within a map (using google's [gmap3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) API).

## Screenshots

The following screenshots are taken from the [demo app](https://github.com/danhaywood/isis-wicket-gmap3/tree/master/zzzdemo) (adapted from Isis' quickstart archetype).  Each `ToDoItem` has been made `Locatable`.

Note: this screencast shows how to edit the app generated by the [quickstart archetype](../../../../intro/getting-started/quickstart-archetype.html).  As of 1.4.0-snapshot, the comments/hints have been removed from the Isis archetype.  Instead, you can just use the [demo app](https://github.com/danhaywood/isis-wicket-gmap3/tree/master/zzzdemo) that comes with the github project.
