Title: Wicket viewer

The wicket module provides a customizable webapp viewer for an Isis domain model, implemented using the [Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org) web framework.

Like the [HTML viewer](../html/about.html), the wicket viewer provides a generic webapp with a page displayed for each entity or collection of entities. Unlike that viewer, though, you can also customize the GUI.
