Isis graduated from the Apache incubator in October 2012; we are currently setting ourselves up as a top-level project.

Our original incubator website is still accessible [here](http://incubator.apache.org/isis "Apache Isis (incubator website)").

We expect to have our migration to a top level project (along with an initial release) this side of Xmas 2012.
