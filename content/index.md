Apache Isis is a framework to let you rapidly develop domain-driven apps in Java. It defines a clean programming model, has BDD and JUnit testing support, and can dynamically (at runtime) generate a representation of that domain model using various presentation technologies.

We graduated from the Apache incubator in October 2012, and are currently setting ourselves up as a top-level project.

Our incubator website is still accessible [here](http://incubator.apache.org/isis "Apache Isis (incubator website)").

You can download the Isis source code using:

    svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/isis/trunk

We expect to have our top level migration out and an initial release this side of Xmas 2012.
