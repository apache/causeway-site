Title: Bypass Security

{stub
This page is a stub.

The bypass security component consists of an implementation of both the `AuthenticationManager` and `AuthorizationManager` APIs, and are intended for prototyping use only.

The authentication manager allows access with any credentials (in a sense, "bypassing" authentication), while the authorization manager provides access to all class members (in a sense, "bypassing" authorization).
