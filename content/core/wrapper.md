Title: Wrapper Domain Service

The 'wrapper' domain service provides the ability for domain objects to be wrapped such that interactions between domain objects can be "as if" through the viewer. (In other words, business rule constraints are applied).

The service is defined through the `WrapperFactory` API, defined in the core applib.
