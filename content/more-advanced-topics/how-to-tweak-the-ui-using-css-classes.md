How to tweak the UI using CSS classes
-------------------------------------

> This how-to applies to the Wicket viewer only.

The HTML generated by the Wicket viewer include plenty of CSS classes so that you can tweak the UI if required.

### Targetting individual members

For example, the `ToDoItem` object of the [ToDo app](../intro/getting-started/quickstart-archetype.html) has a `notes` property.  The HTML for this will be something like:

    <div>
        <div class="property ToDoItem-notes">
            <div class="multiLineStringPanel scalarNameAndValueComponentType">
                <label for="id83" title="">
                    <span class="scalarName">Notes</span>
                    <span class="scalarValue">
                        <textarea
                            name="middleColumn:memberGroup:1:properties:4:property:scalarIfRegular:scalarValue" 
                            disabled="disabled" 
                            id="id83" rows="5" maxlength="400" size="125" 
                            title="">
                        </textarea>
                        <span>
                        </span>
                    </span>
                </label>
           </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    

The `src/main/webapp/css/application.css` file is the place to add application-specific styles.  By way of an example, if (for some reason) we wanted to completely hide the notes value, we could do so using:

    div.ToDoItem-notes span.scalarValue {
        display: none;
    }

You can use a similar approach for collections and actions.


### Targetting members through a custom CSS style

The above technique works well if you know the class member to target, but you might instead want to apply a custom style to a set of members.  For this, you can use the `@CssClass`.

For example, in the `ToDoItem` class (as shown [here](https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/prepare/isis-viewer-wicket-1.3.1-RC1/example/application/quickstart_wicket_restful_jdo/dom/src/main/java/dom/todo/ToDoItem.java#L172)) the following annotation (indicating that this is a key, important, property) :

    @CssClass("x-key")
    public LocalDate getDueBy() {
        return dueBy;
    }

would generate the HTML:

    <div>
        <div class="property ToDoItem-dueBy x-key">
            ...
        </div>
    </div>

This can then be targeted, for example using:

    div.x-key span.scalarName {
    	color: red;
    }


Note also that instead of using `@CssClass` annotation, you can also specify the CSS style using a [dynamic layout](../../core/dynamic-layouts.html) JSON file:

    ...
    dueBy: {
        cssClass: { value: "x-key" }
    },
    ...

This is in fact how the `ToDoItem` class has been refactored to, as shown [here](https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/5e5b07c4691cbd651023c6ed8b7b756bc8370e09/example/application/quickstart_wicket_restful_jdo/dom/src/main/java/dom/todo/ToDoItem.layout.json#L94).

### Application-specific 'theme' class [1.4.0-SNAPSHOT]

The application name (as defined in the `IsisWicketApplication` subclass) is also used (in sanitized form) as the CSS class in a `<div>` that wraps all the rendered content of every page.

For example, if the application name is "ToDo App", then the `<div>` generated is:

    <div class="todo-app">
        ...
    </div>

You can therefore use this CSS class as a way of building your own theme for the various elements of the wicket viewer pages.
