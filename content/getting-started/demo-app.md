Title: Demo Application

We've deployed a [simple demo app](http://mmyco.co.uk:8180/isis-onlinedemo) so you can see Isis in action. The app is deployed with both the default HTML viewer and using the [RESTful web service](viewers/restfulobjects/about.html), running against an in-memory object store. To use, you'll need to register an account (the credentials are stored only in memory and are reset nightly).

The webapp has full documentation to guide you further. It also links to the application's source so you can see how little code you need to write to get an application up and running with Isis.
