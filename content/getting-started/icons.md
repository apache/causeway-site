Title: Icons

Most Isis viewers use icons to help identify domain objects in the user interface.  It's a good idea to ensure that these are styled consistently.  To get you started, we provide a number of icon sets, and reference a few others freely available.

Currently our [icon sets](http://incubator.apache.org/isis/icons.html) are available from our original incubator website.   We will move the content here when that site is decommissioned.

## Third Party Icon Sets

You might also want to explore these additional icon sets.  We believe they can be used freely in your applications, but please do double check their licensing first:
