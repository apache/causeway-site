Title: Icons

Most Isis viewers use icons to help identify domain objects in the user interface.  It's a good idea to ensure that these are styled consistently.  To get you started, we provide a number of icon sets, and reference a few others freely available.

Currently our [icon sets](http://incubator.apache.org/isis/icons.html) are available from our original incubator website.   We will move this content when that site is decommissioned.
