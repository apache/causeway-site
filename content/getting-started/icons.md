Title: Icons

Most Isis viewers use icons to help identify domain objects in the user interface.  It's a good idea to ensure that these are styled consistently.  To get you started, we couple of basic icon sets:

* [haywood](https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/src/site/resources/images/icons/haywood.zip?raw=true)
* [nogl](https://github.com/apache/isis/blob/master/src/site/resources/images/icons/nogl.zip?raw=true)


## Third Party Icon Sets

There are also various open source icon sets; a good one to get started with is the [tango desktop](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library) icon set.

We believe this can be used freely in your applications, but please do double check the licensing of any icon sets before using them.
