## Latest-n-greatest

Isis graduated from the Apache incubator in October 2012; we are currently setting ourselves up as a top-level project.

In the meantime, you can download the Isis source code using:

    git clone https://git.apache.org/isis.git


## Examples

There are some examples of running against the current snapshot; see [here](getting-started/examples.html).

## Previous releases

Our previous incubator release, 0.2.0-incubating, is still available from Maven central repo.  Easiest way to use that the [Quickstart Archetype](getting-started/quickstart-archetype.html).
