Isis graduated from the Apache incubator in October 2012; we are currently setting ourselves up as a top-level project.

In the meantime, you can download the Isis source code using:

    svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/isis/trunk

There is also a mirrored copy up on [github](https://github.com/danhaywood/apache-isis-tlp); we'll be moving over to Apache supported git infrastructure shortly.
