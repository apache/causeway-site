Title: Downloads

## Latest-n-greatest

Isis graduated from the Apache incubator in October 2012; we are currently setting ourselves up as a top-level project.

In the meantime, you can download the Isis source code using:

    svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/isis/trunk

There is also a mirrored copy up on [github](https://github.com/danhaywood/apache-isis-tlp).  We'll be moving over to Apache supported git infrastructure shortly (but will maintain a github mirror).


## Previous releases

Our previous incubator release, 0.2.0-incubating, is still available from Maven central repo.  Easiest way to use that the [Quickstart Archetype](getting-started/quickstart-archetype.html).
