## RRRADDD!!! Really Ridiculously Rapid Application Development (Domain-Driven)

Jeroen and Dan ran this tutorial at the [J-Fall 2012](http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2012/sessions/00029/) conference as a 50 minute-long session.  It seemed to go well, though we reckon you probably need about 90 minutes to complete it.

The tutorial is based on a slightly-modified version of the quickstart archetype, configured to use the Wicket viewer and JDO ObjectStore and pointing at a snapshot in the Apache snapshot repo.  You can download the zip [here](resources/tutorials/rrraddd/myapp.zip); the PDF for the tutorial is [here](resources/tutorials/rrraddd/RRRADD%20lab.v0.5.pdf).

And if you've built Isis locally, then you might want to tweak the `pom.xml` of the app to reference the latest-n-greatest snapshot.
