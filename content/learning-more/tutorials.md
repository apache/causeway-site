## RRRADDD!!! Really Ridiculously Rapid Application Development (Domain-Driven)

### 2012 edition

Jeroen and Dan ran this tutorial at the [J-Fall 2012](http://www.nljug.org/jfall/) conference as a 50 minute-long session.  It seemed to go well, though we reckon you probably need about 90 minutes to complete it.

The tutorial is based on a slightly-modified version of the quickstart archetype, configured to use the Wicket viewer and JDO ObjectStore and pointing at a snapshot in the Apache snapshot repo.  You can download the zip [here](resources/tutorials/rrraddd/myapp.zip); the PDF for the tutorial is [here](resources/tutorials/rrraddd/RRRADD%20lab.v0.5.pdf).

And if you've built Isis locally, then you might want to tweak the `pom.xml` of the app to reference the latest-n-greatest snapshot.


### 2013 edition

At [Oredev 2013](http://oredev.org/2013) Dan delivered a [presentation](http://oredev.org/2013/wed-fri-conference/rrraddd-ridiculously-rapid-domain-driven-and-restful-apps-with-apache-isis) with the same title, showing how to build an app with Isis.

To support that presentation, there is a [github project](https://github.com/danhaywood/rrraddd-isis-131), set up to run against Isis v1.3.1.  You can run throug the README of that project, or just do a `git checkout` for each of the various tags (22 in all!)
